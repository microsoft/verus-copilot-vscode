/*
 This lemma is often useful to put near the end of a loop body that has a loop invariant involving Seq::subrange(j, k), with k being the loop index. It will help prove the property of range j..k+1 of a Sequence based on the property held for range j..k of a Sequence.
 
 Example usage:
    while ( k < s.len() )
      invariant
          ...
          k <= s.len(),
          ...s@.subrange(j, k as int)...,
          ...
    {
       ...
       proof{
       	  lemma_seq_subrange_ascend(s@, j, k+1);
       }
       k = k + 1;
    }

    requires
        0<= i < j <= v.len(),
    ensures
        v.subrange(i, j as int).drop_last() == v.subrange(i, j-1 ),
{
    assert(v.subrange(i, j as int).drop_last() =~= v.subrange(i, j-1));
